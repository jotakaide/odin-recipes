    <p><h3>An amazing pineapple pizza.</h3></p>
    <p>We are going to make a simple pineapple pizza recipe. 
        We will go from the correct way to make the dough to cooking. 
        Going through all the ingredients we will need to make it.</p>
     <p>If you don't like pineapple, you can change this ingredient for 
        any other you like.</p>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Pizza mass</li>    
        <li>Natural pineapple</li>    
        <li>Cooked ham</li>    
        <li>Sweet onion</li>    
        <li>Lard</li>    
        <li>Fresh mozzarella</li>    
        <li>Parmesan, Grana Padano or Pecorino Romano cheese</li>    
        <li>Crushed tomato or passata</li>    </ul>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>We start by preparing the dough. Dissolve the yeast in the water. 
            Let rest 5 min. Mix with the flour and oil. Knead for 5 minutes. 
            Add the salt and knead for 5 to 10 more minutes. 
            Grease a large container and let the dough rest in it, 
            covered with a damp kitchen towel. 
            The rest time varies from 1 hour 30 to 2 hours.</li>
        <li>Cut the mozzarella into thin slices and place them on a clean kitchen 
            towel to drain as much as possible. Leave it for a while or even overnight.</li>
        <li>Prepare the sauce. Brown the garlic in oil over medium heat. As soon as it 
            starts to brown, add the tomato. Let it reduce by half. Season with salt, 
            pepper and oregano to taste.</li>
        <li>Stretch the pizza dough so that it is 28 cm in diameter on a surface sprinkled with 
            durum wheat semolina, cornstarch or, failing that, flour. With the first option 
            the base will be like that of pizzerias.</li>
        <li>Hawaiian pineapple pizza (no bake)
            Spread the base without reaching the edges with tomato sauce. Sprinkle with 
            the parmesan, then the fresh and grated mozzarella. Distribute the ham and 
            pineapple.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10 minutes in the lower part of the oven preheated to 250 ÂºC.
            Out of the oven, you can optionally sprinkle with chives and a few chili 
            flakes or chopped chilli.</li>
        <li>And that's it! See how easy! Enjoy!</li>
