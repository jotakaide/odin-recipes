    <p><h3>A very simple Chinese stir-fry dish which is fabulous in taste. I saw my husband going for two additional servings of it and I had to remind him to 
        leave some for the rest of the family! Serve with hot steamed rice.</h3></p>

    
        <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>

        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>½ pound ground beef</li>
            <li>½ small head cabbage, shredded</li>
            <li>1 red bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cornstarch</li>
            <li>½ cup cold water</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper, or to taste</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt, to taste</li>
        </ul>

        <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>

        <ol>
            <li>Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat, and add oil. Saute garlic for about 5 seconds, then add ground beef. 
                Stir-fry until beef is evenly brown, 5 to 7 minutes; drain excess fat.</li>
            <li>Stir in cabbage and pepper, and cook until vegetables are tender and beef is fully cooked. Stir in soy sauce.</li>
            <li>Mix together cornstarch and water, and stir in. Season with pepper; add salt to taste. Cook, stirring, until sauce has thickened.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>

        </ol>
